# Changing the Color Theme
There are several out-of-the-box color themes for VS Code for you to try out.

1. Open the Color Theme picker with `File | Preferences | Color Theme`.
2. Use the cursor keys to preview the colors of the theme
3. Select the theme you want and hit Enter

## Adding a Theme
You can also add new TextMate theme files (.tmTheme) to your VS Code installation.

[ColorSublime](http://colorsublime.com) has hundreds of existing TextMate themes to choose from.  Pick a theme you like and copy the Download link to use in the Yeoman generator e.g. http://colorsublime.com/theme/download/40781.  The ['code' generator](https://github.com/Microsoft/generator-code) will prompt you for the URL or file location of the .tmTheme file, the theme name as well as other information for the theme.

Copy the generated theme folder to a new folder under `.vscode/extensions` and restart VS Code.

Open the Color Theme picker theme with `File | Preferences | Color Theme` and you can see your theme in the dropdown.  Arrow up and down to see a live preview of your theme.
